# **Team Connect**

## **Description**

A node application for dynamically generating a profile page for your team.  The html file is generated to the 'dist' folder.

## **Installation**

To install Team Connect, you can clone the code from my GitHub repository. After cloning the code simply install the packages from the package.json file.  This program uses fs, inquirer and jest for testing.

## **Usage**

To use the project simply run 'node index' on the command line after installing the correct dependencies.  Answer the question prompts and you're done!  A new professional html page for your team will be created in the 'dist' directory

## **Testing**

Some tests you could try out would be checking if there is input validation for the inquirer.prompt questions and after the HTML is generated, see if the links function correctly.
